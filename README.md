# Localized-network-reorganization-leads-to-hyperexcitability-after-injury
Contains Matlab code for the two computational models used in the paper

Folder 'firing-rate' contains firing rate-based computational model.  Folder 'Spiking' contains the spiking computational model of homeostatic sprouting and synaptogenesis after injury.  Both folders contain readme files with instructions on how to run these models in Matlab.   They also contain Word documents with pseudocode.  Models are described in detail in the Methods section of the manuscript.
